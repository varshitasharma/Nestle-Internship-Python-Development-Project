Project Title : Operation Review Report Automation

Project Description: This project is based on facilitating the user (company's employees) to review the daily report of various operations with an automated tool. I've developed a Python-based GUI that fetches data from an excel file about various factors of operation like ZLMV (INR Mio), Variance, Overflow ,etc.(in a fixed format) and produces graphical reports of these operations on Factory level and Phase level of the company. The user can use the generated graphical reports in analysis and presentations.

Note: Kindly run the script in a python supported IDE or from Command prompt.
The excel file must be in the same directory as that of python file.
